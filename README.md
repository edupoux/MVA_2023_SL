## Course Objectives

Speech and natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence used in an increasing number of applications; yet, while some aspects are on par with human performances, others are lagging behind. This course will present the full stack of speech and language technology, from automatic speech recognition to parsing and semantic processing. The course will present, at each level, the key principles, algorithms and mathematical principles behind the state of the art, and confront them with what is know about human speech and language processing. Students will acquire detailed knowledge of the scientific issues and computational techniques in automatic speech and language processing and will have hands on experience in implementing and evaluating the important algorithms.
 
Topics:
- speech features & signal processing
- hidden markov & finite state modeling
- probabilistic parsing
- continuous embeddings
- deep learning for language-related tasks (DNNs, RNNs)
- linguistics and psycholinguistics
- comparing human and machine performance

## Prerequisites
Basic linear algebra, calculus, probability theory

## Organization

### 9 courses 
The courses consist in 9 three-hours blocks, followed by an oral
project presentation on week 10. This year, the course will take place in presence, 
every friday afternoons **from 4pm to 7pm** in salle **Henri Cartan**, [45 rue d'ULM](https://www.google.com/maps/place/45+Rue+d'Ulm,+75005+Paris/@48.8424688,2.3420222,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e9e9f3a327:0xb168d68bd2ea2060!8m2!3d48.8423135!4d2.3443182). 

Each three hours block consists in two hours of course, followed by a quizz and Q&A.



### Validation
The validation is in two parts:

- **QUIZZ** (30% of the total grade). You'll be given a link to an on-line questionnaire (google form). You'll be given 30minutes to complete the questionnaire which will be activated exactly at 6:00pm and closed down at 6:30pm. Any forms submitted after the deadline will be automatically rejected, and graded as zero. The QUIZZES will contain comprehension questions and the best 5 grades out of the 6 quizzes will be used for the average. Between 6:30 and 7:00 there will be a Q&A period where you'll be able to ask questions about the course and QUIZZ using an on-line connection.

- **Project.**  (70% of the total grade). You'll work in small groups of 2-4 around a recent paper in speech or language processing which has already some existing code. Your task will be 1. to replicate the main result of the paper 2. run a  experiment testing a new question not tested in the paper. You'll present your plan in a one page document in week #3, and your results in a 4 pages documend and 10 minutes oral presentation + 5 minutes questions in week #10. 

the list of possible projects will be made available  here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12hI1JfS2S9dKreXwdmdi1DAYx72ANA1KvlWorMMT0zY/edit#gid=0


ATTENTION: since there is no "exam", there is no possibility of "rattrapage" (ie, of compensating a bad mark by taking another exam). So, if the overall grade obtained in this course is less than 10/20, this course will not be considered validated by the MVA Master.

## details for the QUIZZ

The QUIZZ will be composed of comprehension questions regarding the course you've just watched. You will have 15 minutes to complete the Google form which will be activated after the main part of the course and closed 15 minutes after. We will then briefly discuss the answers.

## details for the PROJECT
You will be given a list of papers to choose from.

Your first task (week #1-#3) is to select a paper of interest, and make up a group of 2-4 people to work on this paper. 

Your second task (week #3) will be to decide on a plan for the experiment you'd like to run and write a 1p document describing what you want to do and who will do what. Attention! any delay in submitting your paper will cost you points (1/24th of a point for each hour of delay after sunday midnight before the monday of week #4).

Your third task will be to conduct the work and prepare (1) a written document (4 p max) describing what you've done and the main results. You may differ from the 1p, but will have to explain how and why. The 4 p should also contain a statement of contribution (who did what), (2) and oral 10 minutes presentation. (there will be 5 minutes of question aferwards).


## Where:

All the courses will be delivered remotely. 

The course materials (PDFs, etc.) are listed in the subdirectories numbered #1 .. #9. 



### Q&A

_What happens if i get less than 10/20 on average? Can I take another exam? _


No, there is no possibility of 'rattrapage'; any obtained grade is final.


_What happens if i cannot be present to the course, and therefore cannot do the on-line QUIZZ?  _


Failure to submit the QUIZZ on time will result in a zero/20 for that QUIZZ, unless you can demonstrate that it was materially impossible for you to be present to the course. Such documented requestes should be sent to mva.speech.language@gmail.com together with the name and date of missed QUIZZ. The best 5 grades out of the 6 quizzes will be used for the average, giving you the possibility of one missing course.
